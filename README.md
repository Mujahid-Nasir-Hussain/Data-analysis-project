## 🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of data analysis, including:

* **Data acquisition**
* **Data cleaning and preprocessing**
* **Exploratory data analysis (EDA)**
* **Statistical analysis**
* **Data visualization**
* **Insight generation and recommendations**

The goal is to apply analytical skills to draw meaningful conclusions that can drive decision-making or support further research.
