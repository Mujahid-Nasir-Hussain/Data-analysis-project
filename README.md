## 🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of data analysis, including:

* **Data acquisition**
* **Data cleaning and preprocessing**
* **Exploratory data analysis (EDA)**
* **Statistical analysis**
* **Data visualization**
* **Insight generation and recommendations**

The goal is to apply analytical skills to draw meaningful conclusions that can drive decision-making or support further research.

## 🛠 Tools and Technologies

The project was built using the following tools:

* **Python** (main programming language)
* **Pandas** and **NumPy** (data manipulation)
* **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** (data visualization)
* **Jupyter Notebook** (interactive development)
* **Scikit-learn** (basic machine learning, if applicable)

> You can easily run and modify the notebooks if you have Python and Jupyter installed.
